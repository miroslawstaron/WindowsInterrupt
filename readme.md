# Setting up Interrupts on Timer in Windows

In Lecture 5, we discuss interrupts on timers. We start with MS Windows and visual studio. This code demonstrates how to set-up interrupts on timers and callbacks.

Then we go to Posix systems and demonstrate how to set-up interrupts on timers and callbacks.

The code for Arduino is on TinkerCad. Please look at the lecture at Canvas for the links.
